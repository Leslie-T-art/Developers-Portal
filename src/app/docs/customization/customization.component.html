                            Prompt allows you to easily customize the styling as well as content of the
                            common elements including top navbar or heros.

                        <h5 class="mt-4">Customize Styling (SCSS)</h5>

                        <p class="mb-1">Prompt comes with the power of Sass (scss). Scss lets you use
                            features that don't
                            exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty
                            goodies that make writing CSS fun again.</p>

                        <p class="mb-1">You can easily modify the themes by simply changing few variables.
                            You even don't
                            need to change anything in Prompt's source code. You can easily defined the
                            override variables in <code>src/assets/scss/skins/default</code>.</p>

                        <p>You can even create a completely new theme by simply copying the
                            <code>src/assets/scss/skins/default</code> folder and then override the values
                            available in the file <code>_variable.scss</code> or
                            <code>_custom-variables.scss</code>.
