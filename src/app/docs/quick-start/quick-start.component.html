                        <p>Prompt Angular is created using <a href="https://angular.io/cli" target="_blank">Angular
                                CLI</a>.</p>
                        <p>In case if you don't know - Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool to help
                            developers build angular applications with simply just one command. It set up and
                            configures everything automatically and so you don't need to configure anything
                            manually (e.g. No need to install and configure tools like webpack or babel).
                            they are preconfigured by creating angular app.</p>

                                <strong>Install Prerequisites</strong>
                                <p>
                                    Make sure to have all the above prerequisites installed &amp; running on
                                    your computer

                                    Open your terminal, go to your folder and enter the command
                                    <code>yarn</code>. This would install all required dependencies in
                                    <code>node_modules</code> folder. And now, you are ready to run the React
                                    for the first time.
